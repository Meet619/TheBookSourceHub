                Java is one of the most popular programming language nowadays. There are plenty of books for beginners. But to those who have programmed with Java for a while, some of them may look redundant. However, advanced Java books are not always right at 
                hand, not partially because they require more skills, experienced, and deep thinkers to write.
                This  book is also usable for  experienced Java developers. Book like "Thinking in Java" or "Head First Java" won't be listed although this book is  very good for beginners.<br>
